        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>Put a 28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl 
                        and crush by hand until the tomatoes are bite-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Finely chop half a white onion and smash and peel a few 
                        cloves of garlic. Into a high walled sauté plan, put a few 
                        tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium until shimmering.</li>
                <li>Once shimmering, add chopped onion and sweat for 2-3 minutes
                        or until translucent around the edges, then add crushed garlic 
                        and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant. When fragrant,
                         add a pinch of crushed red pepper flake, a shake of oregano, 
                         a shake of basil, and 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste. 
                         Cook together for one minute.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes along with a tablespoon of sugar. 
                        Simmer for 20-30 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly
                         to prevent scorching, until the raw tomato flavor has cooked 
                         off and the sauce is thick. You know it’s thick enough when 
                         you drag a spoon through the sauce, it will part.</li>

            </ol>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Into a stand mixer bowl, add 1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) of active dry yeast and a teaspoon of sugar to 8 ¼ ounces of room temperature water. Let bloom for 10 minutes until foamy. In a separate bowl, whisk together 12 ½ ounces of all-purpose flour, 2 ½ ounces of medium grind cornmeal, 1 ½ teaspoons of kosher salt, and ⅛ teaspoon of cream of tartar. Pour dry ingredients into yeast mixture. Then add ⅓ cup plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>Using a dough hook, stir the mixture on low speed for 1-2 minutes until dough is off the side of the bowl. Then, put speed to medium for 7-8 minutes to knead until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too hydrated, lightly flour a cooking surface and knead by hand for an additional 1-2 minutes until consistency is soft and tacky, but not sticky.</li>
                <li>Stretch dough into a ball and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, tossing to make sure it’s fully covered in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and sit out at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Lubricate a 12-inch cast iron skillet with vegetable oil. Grease your hands and coax the dough out of the bowl and into the pan. Push into the shape of a pizza by stretching and pushing the dough up to the sides of the pan. Let rest under cover of plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes. While this rests, you can start your tomato sauce (see recipe above).</li>
                <li>Press dough to sides of the pan, and it should easily hold its shape. Optional: Lay down a layer of raw mild Italian sausage into a nice even layer before the cheese.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of deli-style sliced Provolone cheese on top next, then follow with a thick layer of low moisture mozzarella. More cheese = more cheese stretch!</li>
                <li>Generously top cheese with tomato sauce until cheese is hidden. Then, sprinkle pre-grated parmesan on the sauce and drizzle olive oil on both the sauce and around the edge of the crust.</li>
                <li>Put into 425°F oven for 25-35 minutes, rotating once during baking until cooked through. Run a thin spatula around the outside edge to make sure that there’s no sticking. Slide pizza out the pan and wait at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving pizza. Enjoy!</li>
