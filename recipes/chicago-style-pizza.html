        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put a 28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl 
                        and crush by hand until the tomatoes are bite-sized pieces.</li>
                    <li>Finely chop half a white onion and smash and peel a few 
                        cloves of garlic. Into a high walled sauté plan, put a few 
                        tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium until shimmering.</li>
                    <li>Once shimmering, add chopped onion and sweat for 2-3 minutes
                        or until translucent around the edges, then add crushed garlic 
                        and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant. When fragrant,
                         add a pinch of crushed red pepper flake, a shake of oregano, 
                         a shake of basil, and 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste. 
                         Cook together for one minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes along with a tablespoon of sugar. 
                        Simmer for 20-30 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly
                         to prevent scorching, until the raw tomato flavor has cooked 
                         off and the sauce is thick. You know it’s thick enough when 
                         you drag a spoon through the sauce, it will part.</li>
                <li>Drop by rounded tablespoon onto lightly greased cookie sheet</li>
                <li>Bake at 350 for 15 minutes or until lightly browned</li>
                <li>Remove from cookie sheet to a wire rack to cool</li>
            </ol>
